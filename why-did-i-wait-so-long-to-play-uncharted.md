I had a PS3 for years, and never played Uncharted.

I got a PS4 in November. It came with the [Uncharted collection](http://amzn.to/29dtFkp). I still didn't play it.

Finally.. after much prodding from a work colleague I put the disk in and got stuck in. Holy crap! What an amazing game! I've only played Drake's Fortune but wow. Just wow.

The whole game is paced spectacularly; I never had a dull moment; the difficulty curve was great (the mutants can go fuck themselves!!); and the story was neither too long (Looking at you: Every JRPG ever) or too short.

10/10 - Best game I've played so far this year. If you have a PS4 and you haven't got it... Go [buy it](http://amzn.to/29dtFkp) right now.

I'm going to leave 2 & 3 for a while whilst I catch up some of other games.. Maybe Fallout 4, or something portable like [Fire Emblem](http://amzn.to/29aqJDI). Whatever takes my fancy.
