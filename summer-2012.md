I want to outline my goals for Summer this year so that unlike last year it doesn't just drift passed without me achieving much! I want to keep the goals pretty varied, and I'll post updates as time passes to keep my motivated!

To start with, I am going to get a six week gym membership as soon as I finish uni in the next few weeks. I want to go at least three times a week, in addition to walking/jogging/clutching my chest thinking I'm going to die three or four times a week after work. I want to start geocaching again too, something I haven't done for several years.  
All this exercising is going to be logged by RunKeeper, and I'm going to set some reasonable goals on there for distance etc. Overall, I want to lose about 14kg before September. I eat pretty healthily when I'm at home; I just fall down epically whenever I'm out. I need to start buying healthier food and not buying lunch at work at £5 a pop. That shit is expensive.

I want to cut out most if not all sugary drinks/energy drinks (Which I shouldn't need over Summer? I'll see...) and drink less coffee... Hmmm.... I doubt it will happen... He says sat drinking the equivalent of two cups of coffee....

Moving on from health goals, I want to watch a good majority of the Lost boxset I bought months ago and never around to watching it. I also want to complete a few of my outstanding DS games like Chrono Trigger, Ocarina of Time, and Super Mario 3D Land that I haven’t got around to completing. No doubt I'll get distracted by something new though... I always do... (Just going to casually ignore the spreadsheet I made this time last year!)

To sum up... lose around 14-15kg, get healthy, watch Lost, play games, go geocaching! Sounds like a good summer to me!
