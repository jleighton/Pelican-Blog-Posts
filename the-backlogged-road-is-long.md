I am slowly making progress through my backlog. Maybe by 2045 I'll complete it.... From the first list of games to play that I posted after exams ended in May, I tried to spend time on Bad Rats (but it kept crashing), played some Hack Slash and Loot (doubt I'll make it to an hour, I really don't like it that much) and started on Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.

I'm quite enjoying Fate of Atlantis and it's reminded me how much I enjoy old LucasArts point and click adventures. I'll have to stop off at Monkey Island soon. They're just so much fun! Anyway whilst I continue to play OpenTTD and ignore my backlog, I thought I'd create a top games list for each of my backlogged console platforms. Here goes!

WiiU
----

-   Lego Hobbit (15h)
-   Earthbound (30h)
-   Pikmin 3 (15h)

I've done a few days in Pikmin 3, and I've completed a chunk of LEGO Hobbit. I'll probably just keep doing time trials in Mario Kart 8, though. Add me on Miiverse if you want to: geekyjames.

3DS/DS
------

-   Phoenix Wright Dual Destinies (30h)
-   Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask (25h)
-   Magical Starsign (40h)

I'm on the 3rd case in Dual Destinies, likely going to have to restart Miracle Mask due to forgetting the story and hopefully able to get over the slooooow text in Magical Starsign although I couldn't last time I tried.

Vita/PSP
--------

Heh, the screenshots do it better justice... Let's just say I've not started any of these really... I should pick one at random and aim to complete it. The random number generator said 3, 7, and 23... which are... Final Fantasy Tactics, Lemmings (I can finish that!), and Hotline Miami. I'll give that my best shot...

PS3
---

Assassins Creed series, Ni No Kuni, Burnout CRASH... So many Playstation Plus games, that honestly makes me wonder why I bother paying around Â£40 a year for games that I'm likely not going to play since I still buy games on the PSN Store... At least I didn't buy a single game in the latest steam sale!

Time to crack on, shame I'm back at work for nine days starting this week... At least I've finally moved house, and have few responsibilities if any until October when uni starts back up!
