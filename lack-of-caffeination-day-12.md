Short post this evening! It’s day 12 without energy drinks. Thankfully the headaches subsided a week ago, and I’m sleeping much better according to the alarm clock on my phone (which sits on my bed whilst I sleep). I haven’t really missed energy drinks that much, except late in the afternoon when it sometimes hits like it did today at work at around 5pm.

Overall, I’m pretty glad I cut out the energy drinks. Perhaps I should work on all fizzy drinks next? I just wish I cut down more gradually than I did: those headaches were a bitch.
