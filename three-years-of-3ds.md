3ds The 3DS is three this year, now if you’re in Japan and next month everywhere else. Inspired by a post on Reddit, I thought I would take a look back at my 3DS’s Activity Log (which is something every gaming system ought to have!) Here we go:

2011

I bought my system just before the price drop so I got the Ambassador games. Still, it was a pretty bleak year for the 3DS. I was still playing DS games on the DSi XL I had at the time though, so that stats are probably a bit lower than they ought to be.

Total Playtime: 30:58

Total Steps: 60318

Titles: 36

Average / Title: 51 minutes

Mario Kart 7: 5:15

Ocarina of Time: 3:13

eShop: 3:03

2012

I completed a load of Professor Layton games this year, as well as both Generation V Pokemon games. Apparently I didn’t play much else, or what I did play for long with that poor average per game. I played some Mario games and realised I’m crap at platformers so I never got around to completing them, and various eShop titles. This was also the year that I took my 3DS to college every day as seen by the massive increase in steps throughout the year!

Aha, finally! Games are coming! I went from playing3 hours a week to over 7! This year mainly saw Animal Crossing (which was the main reason I bought a 3DS in the first place, I knew AC would arrive eventually!) and of course Pokémon Gen 6.

So far this year, I’ve just played Pokémon and Animal Crossing. Hmm. I have so many other great titles to play: MH3, Link Between Worlds, the various Level 5 Guild games from the eShop, Phoenix Wright (that I only bought as it was on sale) among many many others. I wonder what I’ll get around to completing this year!
