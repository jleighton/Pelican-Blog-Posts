We were on holiday for the 'actual' week \#2, and spent most of the week sat in the sun drinking all inclusive cocktails & eating pizza around the clock. I didn't have many goals for week 2, so we are going to skip it.

Now, for the POST TRUTH week \#2...

1.  Walk at least last weeks average steps per day, 8660.
2.  Go the gym 3 times
3.  Smash the rings on my Apple Watch
4.  Eat healthily, drink less! (Should be easy after last week!)
5.  Lose most of my holiday weight... ðŸ˜²
6.  Finish a book I've already started reading
7.  Get to the credits in any game I haven't completed before.

The trend this week is getting back into the swing of being healthy & overall self improvement. After all my second half mudder isn't very far away......Â ðŸ¤”
