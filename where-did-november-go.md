November has flown by, it's nearly Christmas once again and I'm getting swamped by university work and games. Mainly by uni work, because I insist on not doing it when I really ought to. The ten hours of Skyrim I played were amazing, but I really need a few solid days to get into it properly. Which isn't going to happen! I preordered Saints Row the 3rd on Onlive to get a free microconsole, which did work out pretty well seeing I got a free copy of Tropico 4 since the console was delayed. Still haven't played Saints Row yet, though.

 

And I now have three lab reports to write, and three assignments due next week, and Mario Kart 7 to play on Friday (if Amazon manage to deliver it, that is).
