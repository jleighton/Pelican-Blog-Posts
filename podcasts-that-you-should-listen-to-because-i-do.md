And now for some recommendations for you to listen to… Here are three podcasts which I really quite like.

### [Skeptoid](http://skeptoid.com)

Weekly podcast about things you should be skeptical about. Recent episodes include The Mystery of the Mary Celeste, The Toxic Lady, and the Top 10 Worst Anti-Science websites. Short and to the point.

### [Chemistry in its element](http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/podcast/element.asp)

Another short weekly podcast about you guessed it… chemicals! Produced by [the Naked Scientists](http://www.thenakedscientists.com/) (who also do several brilliant longer weekly podcasts about science news), each episode is delivered by different people on varying elements, and substances. Once a week, five minutes long.

### [Stuff you should know](http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/hsw-shows/stuff-you-should-know-podcast.htm)

One of the several [How Stuff Works podcasts](http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/hsw-shows), this one deals with things you should well.. know? A great way to kill an hour with an always interesting topic. Coffee and orgasms came up recently.
