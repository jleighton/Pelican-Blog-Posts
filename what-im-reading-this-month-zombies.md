This month I've been reading Zombie: An Anthology of the Undead (edited by Christopher Golden). So far, both are recommended. If you like Max Brooks' zombie books (World War Z and the Zombie Survival Guide) then you'll most likely love the variety of short stories found in the anthology, including one by Max Brooks himself but I haven't gotten that far yet. Hopefully I'll get enough time to finish it this month.

Just a quick note, it seems that it has been released under the alternate title of The New Dead with identical content (and a missing Kindle edition)
