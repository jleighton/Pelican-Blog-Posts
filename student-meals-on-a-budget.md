Tonight’s dinner was cheap. Really cheap! A handful of pasta, 1/3 of a jar of Pasta bake sauce, and around 150g of frozen mince from Morrison’s. All up it probably cost less than £1 for my meal. And it was surprisingly tasty.

The mince is beef/pork and was £1.70 / kg. A kilo of pasta was like £1 from Home Bargains, and the sauce was 75p a jar.

Cook the pasta in a saucepan, whilst browning the mince in a pan. Once browned add however much sauce you want to use. 1/3 of a can worked well, but you can vary it based on your tastes. Once the pasta is cooked, drain and add to the mince/sauce.

You could add mushrooms, onions, or garlic if you want (but I had none available so…). Cook the pasta and coat with the sauce for a few minutes. Serve and add some cheese (if you’re not stingy like I am). I did add some olives I had in the cupboard though. They were pretty nice.

Enjoy! Try different pasta bake sauces for different tastes. Tiny pepperoni slices appeared in my bowl which was pretty cool….
