Roller Coaster Tycoon Classic came out on iPad this week and it's awesome fun. In every way, it is exactly like the original games I spent so long with as a child.

If only there were more mobile games like this! Imagine full versions of Theme Hospital, SimCity 2000, SimTower, Age of Empires.... It would be amazing.

I've played through an entire Park now (Dynamite Dunes) and everything feels perfect. The game plays exactly how I remember it, the touch controls are brilliant and I experienced no lag or crashes.

My favourite addition is probably the extra speed controls. You can now make your Park run super speed, which is helpful when waiting to finish a scenario.

If you liked the originals back in the day (or even still like & play them) then please buy RCT Classic and support decent mobile ports!
