This has been a good week! I got my place at Bangor confirmed/approved and this morning I got confirmation of my halls (and now am considerably more poor than I already was... having to pay Â£300 deposit!)

Only 45 days to go now (I'm not counting, honestly...) and after this week everything feels that much closer. I've been on the phone about a transfer for work, and that's almost sorted too.

Seriously cannot wait!
