This is my current (well and first) cross stitching project that I am attempting. It is based on a pattern that I found months ago on the [Sprite Stitch](http://www.spritestitch.com/) forums and is turning out to be a lot bigger than I was expecting. Hopefully, I’ll get it done one day… She’s still waiting! Oops!
