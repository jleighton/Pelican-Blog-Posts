Once a week I’m going to post a list of things I want to achieve in the next week, and then the following week I will post again to see if I achieved those things! Here goes!

I have a week off this week, no uni and no work. So therefore I want to get my Raspberry Pi well on the way to being functional. That should take a day or two on and off, and will be pretty cool when it’s done.

Reading wise I am midway through Breakfast of Champions on my Kindle so I want to make some more progress through that and then maybe start another book in my backlog. Possibly one of the massive books by Neal Stephenson! Gaming? Maybe a few sessions of Roller Coaster Tycoon, since I’m slowing working my way through completely all the park challenges included with RCT1. I’m currently up to Diamond Heights.

On top of this, I want to ride 5-10 miles each day (Monday-Friday) depending on if I can get my seat fixed / replaced. It is bloody uncomfortable! Maybe it’s just my arse, who knows? This is probably the most important goal of the week, I think.  
Be sure to read the follow-up next week!
