This post is to remind me that I should not buy a Nintendo Switch until I have completed a shit load more games that I ALREADY OWN!!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There will be more games out then, they will be cheaper, and you do not need to spend over £300 in March just to play Zelda when you haven't finished most of the Zelda titles you already own. Stop being an idiot.
