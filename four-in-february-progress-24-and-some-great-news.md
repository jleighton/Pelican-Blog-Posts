I am now the champion in Pokemon Black 2! That means that I am 50% of the way through my challenge whilst being 57% of the way through February. There's a high chance I might actually do this!

Elder Scrolls: Oblivion might be an issue because I am likely to get sidetracked... We'll see.... In other awesome news; Animal Crossing New Leaf has a release date for Europe! June 14th! Can't say I'm not just a bit excited... But so is Amelia! It's after uni finishes too which means I won't play it instead of revising... Not that I would ever do that....
