I haven't really gotten into anything much recently. Instead, I tried to play everything at the same time, and got bored of it all before too long.

I started Breath of the Wild, accidentally wiped my save file, started again then didn't really go back to it. I played Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for about 20 hours in the two weeks after it came out, then haven't been back to it at all. Also on Switch I bought World of Goo, I am Setsuna, Disgaea 5, Minecraft and never really got into any of them. Whoops. Just need Stardew Valley so I can buy that too, then not play it.

On PS4 I got back into Formula 1 2016 picking up my save from last September on the super easy mode, because driving F1 cars is hard. I am currently enjoying thoroughly beating everyone even though they basically all forgot how to drive.

I also started Dragon Quest Heroes. Are you seeing a trend yet? I like starting games, I like quitting them *even more*! I'll probably go back to Dragon Quest Heroes next month, or maybe next year. Long winded story games are basically my nemesis.

I even started Omega Ruby again, with the hilarious plan of completing a Living Pokedex. It didn't happen when I was at uni with 30 hours a week spare, and I really doubt I will ever complete a living Pokedex now, or any time in the future.

Going forward I am going to try and play a 'few' games a week, and blogg about them regularly. Maybe this will make me get through my backlog in a reasonable fashion. Maybe I could even set a target of beating 30 games before the end of 2018? We'll see.
