It's been a while since my last blog post... I've been busy with work, the gym... and... playing lots of games! Here's a run down of that last activity.

### **November 2017**

After telling myself I wouldn't be buying Skyrim for the ~~second~~ third time, I bought Skyrim for the third time. I've spent the most time in the game this time, but I still got bored of the main quest. Pretty sure I finished the Dark Brotherhood questline, starting being a thieving shit in the Thieves Guild and generally romped my way across the world.

Playing Skyrim on a portable is really neat, and probably the reason I managed to put so much time into it. I will go back and finish the main quest line at least, but for now I'm done with Skyrim again. I'm hoping for a Fallout port in the future so I can buy those again and play on the go. Please, Bethesda.

I was deep into Stardew Valley too which continued into December. I've spent more time in Stardew Valley (60 hours) than any other Switch game in the last 11 months.

Stardew is just the perfect zone out game after a long day. It's super duper easy to get sucked into 'one more day' too. For now I've stopped playing Stardew until the multiplayer is released later this year so I'm not entirely burned on the game.

Rounding out the top three for November was Super Mario Odyssey. I can't really say much that others haven't. It's such a good game and I need to go back and do it justice at some point. I got to the credits (not hard in any modern Mario) and haven't been back since. I might actually start a new save when I go back.

### **December 2017**

I think there was a Splatfest that I played in... I only really play Splatoon during Splatfests.... Nothing much else to say about December except that I got Mario + Rabbids for Christmas.

### **January 2018**

Golf Story! Golf Story! Golf Story! What a great game!If you own a Nintendo Switch, and don't have Golf Story... what is wrong with you? It's an awesome mix of classic RPG with memorable dialogue mashed together with a decent golf game.

Did I mention it has ~~frisbee~~ disc golf, and mini golf alongside the normal golf you'd expect. I got about 15 hours of playtime out of it, and still CANNOT beat the last tournament. Holy crap, that was a difficulty spike and a half.

### **What I am playing now**

I'm currently stuck into Mario + Rabbids battle kingdom which is seriously catering to my addiction to turn based strategy games.

I think I am about a third of the way through so this will probably take up most of my February. Maybe I'll get into Farming Simulator next... I have a lot to choose from anyways...
