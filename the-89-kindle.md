I've had my shiny new kindle for a week now, and having upgraded from a (somewhat) ancient Sony PRS-505 I'm much happier for it. The screen refreshes that much quicker, it doesn't flash to black on every page turn and some of the bargains I've found in the Kindle eBook store are amazing. Tom Reynold's [sequel](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002SDGLSM "More Blood, More Sweat and Another Cup of Tea") to his book Blood, Sweat and Tea about the London Ambulance Service is just 49p to download. How much better can it get? :-D (If you haven't read them, you should! )

I could of course read books on my phone, or my tablet but to really get into a book and get lost in it, e-ink wins out hands down. Of course, only second to paper. But who likes boring old paper??
