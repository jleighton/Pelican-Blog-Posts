from the Wordpress iPad app. Neat. This bluetooth keyboard is really cool too. Now I can post wherever I am (such as the garden...)

I am off to Wales tomorrow and I'm working today so no more bike rides till Sunday evening or Monday morning. Probably for the best as the seat hurts.

In other news, I am researching full steam ahead for my RasPi project; I think exim might do what I am after as an email forwarder but maybe there is something more suited. Mencoder or ffmpeg is looking good for the time lapse side of things too, just want to find a secure way of transfering photos from the network cam to a USB stick mounted on the Pi. FTP is probably going to be the only way.

Wish me luck!
