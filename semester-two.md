Exams are over, lectures start again on Monday. What am I going to do differently this term? I’m going to study… That is, I’m going to spend at least an hour a night going over my notes. Uploading them to Google Drive. Making sure I understand them. Making sure they’ll make sense in three months time. This lot of exams has been a big shock from what I’ve been used to at college for my ND and HND. Revision? Wow, that was a lot harder than I remembered it being five years ago.

This is a behaviour that I need to change as soon as possible, to give myself the best chance at better exam results in the Summer. Going to the gym (that I’ve already paid for!) is going to be another focus of this semester. We went yesterday, and are currently planning to go most mornings (I have 4/5 9am starts… Welcome to the real world) to make the most of each day and start to feel better about myself. We’ll see how it goes!
