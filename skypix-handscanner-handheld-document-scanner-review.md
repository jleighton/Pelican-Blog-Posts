Being in halls this year, I don’t have a lot of space. My desk is tiny. I hate tiny desks. This pretty much rules out flat bed scanners completely.

I was browsing Amazon looking to waste money like I normally do when I stumbled across handheld portable document scanners for under £30. ‘Hmm’ I wondered, how could can they possibly be? The answer is pretty good!

The [Skypix TSN410 scanner](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004DHYGF6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B004DHYGF6&linkCode=as2&tag=tupcast-21) is portable, lightweight, and not bad quality for an amazing price.

It takes 2 AA batteries (Buy decent ones, the Zinc Carbon ones I got in a hurry lost 1/3 of their charge after about 25-30 scans), transfers via a mini USB cable (Annoying since pretty much everything I own now uses MicroUSB… How things change?) and saves scans to a MicroSD card. (I’m using an 8gb MicroSDHC card I got online for a few quid)

The scanner does feel a little fragile, but it does a really good job. I probably wouldn’t take it with me in my bag, rather just safely store it in a draw except for when I need it.

Included with my scanner was a piece of software called “ABBYY Screenshot Reader” which does a good job of converting the images scanned into editable text. The scanner itself scans to JPEG images at either ‘low’ or ‘high’ resolution. The except spec escapes me… 300 and 600dpi rings a bell though. You can also set it to scan in colour or black and white.

Here are some sample scan of a leaflet that arrived in the post earlier. This is scanned a low resolution because I find the high setting just makes the files ridiculously large without a great deal of benefit.

Frequently Asked Questions about Google AdWords

What is Google AdWords?  
If you've ever searched on Google and seen  
a column of sponsored links just to the right of  
your search results, that's AdWords. Ifs separate  
from our search rankings, and lets you advertise  
to just the people you want to reach.  
How does Google AdWords work?  
Choose a few search terms related to your  
business, plus your daily budget and the amount  
you're willing to pay when someone clicks. When  
customers search one of your terms, your ads  
may appear next to the search results.  
What if I only want to target a specific area?  
Target your neighbourhood; a particular town,  
region, country or the whole world, if you like. Only  
people in the areas you specify will see your ad.  
What if I decide I want to pause my campaign?  
You can pause your campaign at any time, and  
start up again whenever you like. A simple click  
turns your campaign on and off. There's no  
obligation or commitment; ifs up to you whether  
you continue to spend or not...

How much does it cost?  
That's your call. With AdWords, you get  
complete control over what to spend. You get  
to choose your bid price (how much you're  
willing to pay when someone clicks on your ad)  
as well as the most you want to spend on a daily  
basis. The higher your bid price and budget, the  
more often people will see your ads. You can  
change either setting at any time.  
What does it take to get started?  
Just go to the site below. It takes less than 20  
mmutes. Add your code into billing details, and  
we'll automatically top up your account with £75  
when you spend £25\*.

As you can see the quality of the scan is awesome, and the OCR is pretty good too. There are a few errors, but it’s to be expected surely? It wouldn’t take longer than a few seconds to correct them manually. To the left of the scanned image, there is a slight waviness present. The scanner internally adjusts the image if you don’t scan in a perfect straight line. It does a pretty good job, but with the knack of a few scans you get pretty good at pulling the paper/moving the scanner perfectly.

For around £30, I think the scanner is a good investment for students like myself who get handed a ton of handouts that invariably go missing within a week… Now I can store them all in Evernote and not lose them ever.
