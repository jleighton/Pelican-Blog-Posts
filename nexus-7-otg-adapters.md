I’ve used a USB OTG (On the go) adapter with a variety of things so far on my Nexus 7, including:

-   Wired Xbox 360 Controller (Although, I hear it should work with the wireless one with the correct USB dongle)
-   Playstation 2 Controller via a USB adapter designed for a computer
-   Playstation 3 Controller via USB (Haven’t tried using them wirelessly yet.. I think root is needed for that.)
-   32gb USB memory stick (via Stickmount, root required)
-   Apple USB Ethernet Adapter
-   USB Keyboards and Mice

The variety of add-ons I can use with my tablet is pretty amazing. I remember using my iPad with a Wii Remote after I first jailbroke it. But wow, all these pretty much work in Android without any major steps/changes to the tablet with the exception of rooting for Stickmount.  
All of the game controllers that I tested worked great with Snesoid, and Snes9x EX. I probably use those much, since the emulators on PC are that much better but the fact I can is neat.

The Ethernet adapter is really special. The halls that I’m likely to be moving into in September are stuck in the last decade and don’t have wifi access! I just plugged it in, turned off the wifi and everything continued to work. It was a bit strange because there is no indication at all anywhere in the UI that I had even plugged in an ethernet adapter let alone that it was functioning perfectly.

I was able to play various video files from my 32gb USB key through MX Player including a bluray that I had ripped myself. Various other video files also played great. I had less luck with VLC, and MX Player seems to be the player of the moment!
