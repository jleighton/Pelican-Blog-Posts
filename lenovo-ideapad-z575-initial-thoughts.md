My new laptop has the new AMD Llano platform chips buried within; both the 1.5Ghz AMD A8 CPU and a 6620M (the lower powered graphics card) as well as a 6650M. The model code of my particular model is M75D7UK. Other than that, it has a blu-ray reader, a 15” 1366x768 display and weighs about 2.5kg.

I’ve had the machine for just under a week and already I love it. Yes it’s bulkier than my MacBook Air which I sold to get this Lenovo; but it plays Skyrim! No, really, it does! See these screenshots!

Not shabby for a £600 laptop, is it? I’ll do some more tweaking tomorrow whilst I have some free time. Other games I’ve tried so far include Cities in Motion, and Roller Coaster Tycoon (but that last one doesn’t really count!)
