Bucket list update! So, if you look at my bucket list (available at the link above) you’ll see what I wanted to do before, well, now. This included:

Short Term (Before 2014)

-   Watch the Star wars movies (33% Complete! Don't even ask.... +Laurence....)
-   Complete 12 games in 2013 (25% complete!)  
   I want to finish the storylines in a few major series like Fallout, Elder Scrolls, some of the Zelda games before we're hit with even more awesome releases...
    -   ~~Pokemon Black 2~~
    -   ~~Professor Layton and Pandora's Box~~
    -   ~~Professor Layton and the Lost Future~~
    -   ~~Professor Layton and the Last Spectre~~
    -   ~~Lego LOTR~~
    -   ~~Super Mario Bros~~
    -   ~~Gratututious Space Battles~~
-   Read 12 books in 2013 (8.33% Complete!)
    -   ~~Replay - Ken Grimwood~~
-   Save as much money as I can! Stop buying useless crap... Attempt to get out of the student overdraft of doom...
-   Go mountain biking again (this time with a decent bike)
-   Play Artemis in a room with several people

From the bottom, Artemis didn’t happen. Nor did mountain biking. I’m working my way out of my overdraft so that’s a positive. I can’t remember anymore books I read although I did just get ‘We are Anonymous’ for christmas so I’ll give that a read after exams. Gaming-wise in addition to those games, I also completed Pokemon X and Thomas was Alone. That makes 9/12. I’ll take 75%. As for Starwars, we haven’t had a good chance to actually watch them. Maybe we will this year.

As for New Year’s Resolutions, I’ve not had any energy drinks since Christmas Day nor do I intend to drink them in the future. My wallet and teeth are both thankful.
