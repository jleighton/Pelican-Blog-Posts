I've decided to try my hand at producing a Let's Play series on YouTube. Probably an early Pokémon game, possibly Yellow or Blue. I spent a few hours yesterday getting the recording down, and settled on using Camstudio to record the video from VisualBoyAdvance in conjunction with Audacity to remove the background noise from my recording. It seems to work pretty well, so here's the first minute I uploaded to YouTube yesterday with some more coming in the next week!
