It's been a while since I posted anything on my blogs.

I spent Christmas in South Wales, passed my January exams, and completed some games.

Super Mario 3D World was completed with the help of my girlfriend (We've not started the bonus challenge levels yet.), I got around to finishing Phoenix Wright: Dual Destinies at last. Pretty good, but I should probably skip novel-like games in the future. I also completed Dragon Quest IV on the DS which had been nearly completed for months. That was a lot of fun, the last battle was phenomenally difficult.

Anyway, it's back to studying for May exams (last ones ever!) and playing of more games in the between hours of uni/work/uni/work.

I bought Monster Hunter 4 this week so I could experience the online whilst it was still new. I'm also slowly playing through Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker and Fallout: New Vegas. Time is precious! Oh, I got an ambassador New 3DS too which I've been meaning to review at some point!
