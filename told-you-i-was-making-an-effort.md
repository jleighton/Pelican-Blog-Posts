Went out for another ride with Laurence; just under ten miles this time! Honestly, I did have to walk up quite a few of the hills and along the overgrown footpath. My legs just aren’t ready yet… in a few weeks it will all be different!  
Went a different direction completely to last time, and encountered an unmanned level crossing, a camouflaged caravan in a field (down what we thought was the footpath we wanted but wasn’t) and a locked level crossing.

The wind was pretty much against us the entire way back, but we made it eventually and then got home in time to watch the football (which I wasn’t really interested in) and [firework displays](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lDC1doQe2Q) on YouTube. Because I am just that awesome. I’ll keep posting an entry like this after each outing, and every fortnight or so I will update with figures and measurements etc (If only for my benefit really)

Today's photo if of a tree stump sign and the level crossing that we passed through. Don’t worry too much, there wasn't a train nearby.

Also a [handy website](http://zip-zero.com/runkeeper/) if Runkeeper decides to die half way through and you end up with two activities within your account… Export both tracks as GPX from the website, upload them to [this site,](http://zip-zero.com/runkeeper/) and add a manual entry with the new merged GPX file. Amazing.
