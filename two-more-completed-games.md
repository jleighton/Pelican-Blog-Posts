I was in the mood to play some shorter games (as you may have gathered from my last post) so I started back on playing a few of the Level-5 Guild series games that I had on my console: [Liberation Maiden](http://level5ia.com/blackbox/us/liberation-maiden/) and Attack of the Friday Monsters.

### Liberation Maiden

I finished Liberation Maiden in just over an hour on easy mode. It was still pretty challenging for me since I don't particularly like arcade shooters, but it was a lot of fun. One day I might go back to the individual stages to try and beat my scores, but not any time soon.

### Attack of the Friday Monsters

Longer than Liberation Maiden, I also rather enjoyed [Attack of the Friday Monsters](http://www.metacritic.com/game/3ds/attack-of-the-friday-monsters!-a-tokyo-tale) but I feel that the ending was a bit rushed. The game plays like a visual novel (Think sort of Monkey Island) where you go around talking to various characters, looking for clues, and playing a card game to battle NPCs. The battle system was simple and worked, but probably could of been fleshed out a bit. The story was satsifying (I think, I am still going through it in my mind...) and I'd look forward to a sequel if one were to be announced.

On to the next games!
