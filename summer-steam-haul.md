Not a bad haul, just wish I hadn’t bought F1: 2010 or Universe Sandbox. The former is too easy with driving assists turned on, and nearly impossible when you switch them off. The later has no soundtrack. At all. For a universe simulator, I expected something quite ‘epic'.. Oh well :)

Steam is awesome.
