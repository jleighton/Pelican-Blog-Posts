No blog posts for three months. Wow. Well I kept updating my tumblr because that required no thought process. Just reblog, or occasionally post a picture I found on Reddit!

However, since I’ve now passed my first year at university I have all the time in the world at my hands! And boy is it a weird feeling. What should I do? Game? But what game?! Read? Which book? Cross-stitch? I’d rather not right now… Argh…

Hopefully this blog will help me to focus my creative energies and avoid procrastinating the summer away. That’s the idea anyway.
