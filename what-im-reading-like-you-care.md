Currently I'm midway through A Game of Thrones (which I'm finding far more enjoyable than the TV series which I stopped at episode 4! I'm nearly at where I stopped watching, so it'll be interesting to see if it can hold my interest in the next few chapters \[I'm sure it it\]) and I've just started Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson as it was delivered this morning.

The introduction was pretty sad, Steve asked him to write his biography back in 2004 (it turns out soon after he was diagnosed with cancer before it was made public) and Isaacson replied along the lines of "maybe in twenty years when you've retired, you have lots more to give". It took a few years for Isaacson to get started, and now Jobs has sadly passed away the biography has been released. It's certainly going to be interesting read. There is also an hour long interview with the author which you can find [here](http://www.thetechscoop.net/2011/10/24/60-minutes-interview-with-walter-isaacson/).

Other things I'm up to include cross-stitching, rearranging my room, installing linux, and pretty much anything to avoid my uni work.
