Google Latitude completes it's migration into Google Plus this week and after the 9th of August historical location history stored in Latitude is going to be deleted. Make sure you get over to Google Takeout and save your data!

If you're a heavy latitude user like myself with my close friends and family then this suck. Google+ locations is not up to scratch... You can't see how long ago the location was refreshed. How are you supposed to tell if the location is still valid or not? You pretty much can't. You don't get a distance reading to nearby friends, and there's no way to hide people who share their location with all their circles.

Update 31/08/2013: Google+ now reports the time that your friends location was updated! They listened, and now it is considerably more usable.

### Current Alternatives

Anyway, this has prompted me to look for replacements. [Glympse](http://glympse.com/) looks good, except the longest you can share your location to someone is 4 hours. No Latitude replacement. I found an open source project on Github called [Rockwell](https://github.com/tylerhall/Rockwell) which had some server code as well as code for an iPhone app. This got me thinking, why can't I create my own for my friends and family?

Some other alternatives include [Chronos](http://www.getchronos.com/android) which is a life logging app (it doesn't let you share your location with friends) that allows you to import your data from Latitude. Another alternative is called [Hemisphere](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.howettl.hemisphere) which apparently replicates most of the functionality that we've come to love. I haven't tried either of these yet, however.
