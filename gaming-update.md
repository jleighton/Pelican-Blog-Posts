So, I said I was going to play Leviathan Warships, Link’s Awakening, Half Life, and GTA 5. So far I’ve played Link’s Awakening and Pokémon; I blame Pokémon Bank being released in Europe this morning.It’s made me restart my Heart Gold save to obtain the various legendaries found within it’s world of Kanto and Johto. And I’m loving it! I forgot how much I adored the Generation II remakes! It might be because I have vivid memories of playing Silver as a child. I’m not sure, but HGSS are probably my favourite Pokémon games out of the entire series.

Speaking of Bank and Transporter- whilst they work, they aren’t exactly seamless or fun to use. Transporter is a separate app used to transfer Pokémon from Box 1 of your generation 5 game (and only from Box 1, there is no choice here) and place it into the Transport box. Then you have to close Transporter, swap your cartridge out for X or Y and open Bank, not forgetting to swap the cartridge before you start bank, or else you’ll have to exit Bank to get it to recognize the cartridge. Now you can move the transported Pokémon either into permanent storage on the cloud or save them onto your copy of X or Y.

As for Four in February GTA:V is definitely out. I should get some time to play Half Life and Leviathan Warships this week or next, but I’m probably going to get sidetracked by Heart Gold and Monster Hunter 3 in the mean time… I shouldn’t commit myself to play specific games, should I?
