Since February I played mostly games on my Switch...

-   [Oxenfree](http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/oxenfree). It's a short 5 hour point and click adventure, highly recommend it. The story was amazing, don't go looking for spoilers! If you haven't played it, go and play it now.

-   I started playing [Ocarina of Time](https://twitter.com/geekyjames/status/970765422726451200) (again, didn't finish) . Maybe I'll try again later in the year.

-   Almost finished [Mario+Rabbids](https://twitter.com/geekyjames/status/962066024894836738). Need to go back and finish that off at some point.

-   Got stuck into [Football Manager Nintendo Switch Edition](https://twitter.com/geekyjames/status/984897874017206272)Â taking Bangor City to the top of the Welsh Premier League three years in a row.

-   Play a little bit of [N++](http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/nplusplus) every day. There's 4000 levels, it's gonna take a while. 4 hours, 0.048% complete, 1029 deaths... yeah the tweet has a typo. oh well! I quite like how bite sized it is.

-   Played quite a lot of Powgi Wordsearch with Milly. This is a surprisingly fun co-op game. Who knew how angry you get when someone finds the word you've set your heart on finding....

-   Played a bit of Rocket League but didn't get into it fully. Maybe with the next update.

-   Tried to get into Pokemon Ultra Moon. Shit, that's a slow game. Let's hope that the new Switch pokemon games aren't this slow. I think I got to the second island before becoming bored out of my mind.

I am currently deep into Disgaea 5. I think I'm a healthy way into the story, but I keep distracting myself with the Item World. It's pretty much one of my favourite games ever. Between that, and N++ I've not been playing much else.

My Hitlist for the next few months. Pretty heavily 3DS biased, because it's gathering dust and I have a ton of 3DS stuff I've not got to yet! Expect the next gaming update in September.

-   Dragon Quest Builders (NS)
-   Retro City Rampage (NS)
-   Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy (3DS)
-   Zelda Picross (3DS)
-   Pullblox (3DS)
