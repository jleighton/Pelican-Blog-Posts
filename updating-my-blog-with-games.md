I don’t really have much to talk about this week. I have loads of work for uni to do, just three weeks left of project and plenty of assignments to be getting on with. So I thought I’d write a post about the books and games I am currently enjoying.

Since I just bought a PSP Go last week (That’s another story I’ve yet to share with you…) I bought a few classic PSP games on the PSN (Both GTA games, Disgaea, and Final Fantasy 1) and so far I’ve been playing Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories and Disgaea.

I can’t quite get my head around the fact that LCS game out in 2005. When I was fifteen. Seven years ago. It’s just as awesome as I remember it being, and it looks lovely on the Go’s screen.

Disgaea 3 was the reason I was going to buy a Vita (since the remake will be released in April) but I saw that the first two Disgaea games that I have yet to play where both on PSN for about £8. I still have so many DS and PC games that I’ve yet to play so it seems rather silly buying yet another launch console.

I tidied up my shelf last week, here is my DS and 3DS nook:

Out of all these games, I’ve only really completed… none of them fully except I guess the Pokémon games. Shameful I know. And yet I continue to buy games…. I’m not even going to look at the percentage of Steam games I own that I’ve actually played….
