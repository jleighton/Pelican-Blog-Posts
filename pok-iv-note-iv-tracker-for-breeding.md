If you're trying to keep track of the IVs of the Pok√©mon you're breeding then try out this amazingly [simple web app](http://www.itesser.com/projects/pokivnote/index.html). Designed for phones and tablets, but it works alright on a laptop or PC too.

If you need reminding the symbols relate to: HP, Attack, Defence, Speed, Special Attack, Special Defence. So if the [IV Checker](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Stats_judge#In_Generation_VI) in Kiloude City tells you that the best stats are Attack, Speed and Special Defense ('They can't be beat') then mark the triangle, heart, and diamond. These marking show on the status screen of each pokemon and allows you to quickly sort through the many monsters that you've bred.
