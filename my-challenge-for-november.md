So for November I think I'm going to make some small changes to my daily routines. I'll walk my two dogs more often that I do now (rarely), I'll walk to the bus station from uni rather than getting a bus to get a bus, and I'm going to cut down on my caffeine and sugar intake drastically. I might even dust of the Kinect sat downstairs gathering dust; but baby steps first!
