The Nintendo Switch doesn't have an Activity Log built into it like those found on the 3DS or the Wii U. However, if you download the [Nintendo Switch Parental Controls](https://p.nintendo.com/) app which is available for Android and iOS then you will be able to get a list of what games you've been playing.

It's a shame there isn't just a normal activity log... but this will have to do...

The app is designed for parents to be able to limit their children's playtime but you can disable all of that and just use it for the Activity Log goodness.

On thing to note, you will need the Parental Control PIN occasionally... changing Wifi settings, to log into social accounts for sharing and stuff like that. The PIN is emailed to you and you can find it in the app, so you shouldn't lose it!

**Update (Tues 7th March)**

On your profile (click your icon in the top left corner of the home screen) you can see how long you've played a game for (for up to 100 hours..)
