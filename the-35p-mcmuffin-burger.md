These cost about 40p each to make. Morrison's muffins are 49p for four. The burgers are generally 8 for Â£1 (frozen, substitute if you dislike the possibility of eating horse... I don't mind)... I found 6 eggs reduced at Asda for 56p. Combine them to make these pieces of awesomeness and revel in how amazing you really are. Also note the lack of grease running down your arms from this home made version...

Nom!

Swap the burgers for square sausage if you aren't a broke student. Or nicer muffins; or just go buy a real McMuffin since you can probably afford it. Enjoy!
