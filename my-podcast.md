It’s been about 3 months since we recorded [episode 1](http://theunnamedpodcast.wordpress.com/2011/10/22/episode-0-the-cake-is-comic-con/) of our unnamed podcast. I think I’d like to pick it up again soon. Maybe this weekend (unsurprisingly, I have university work that needs doing…) or possible mid February when I have a week off. Maybe I’ll actually get around to starting my let’s play… Who knows?

The time it’s probably going to be a monthly affair up to around an hour or two in lengths covering some of the following topics. Unscripted too.

<ul>
<li>
<div align="justify">

Games (Specifically handheld and PC games, which are my speciality)

</div>

</li>
-   <div align="justify">

    Play a game for a month, and report back on it

    </div>

-   <div align="justify">

    Previews / reviews if we actually buy any games on launch days

    </div>

<li>
<div align="justify">

Hardware (I buy so much useless crap!)

</div>

</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">

Anime / Manga (Not by me, but possibly some of our contributors!)

</div>

</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">

General geek crap

</div>

</li>
</ul>
I’ll post an update when we record (hopefully in the next two weeks!)
