I seem to have a problem. I keep buying games (, books and movies are also included) and then never get around to playing them. I should really have more self control; I even made a list of what games to play by when back over the Summer. Let's see how that went...![](http://jamesleighton.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/gamebacklog.png "gamebacklog"){.aligncenter .size-full .wp-image-89 width="590" height="173"}

Out of all of those games, I've only completed Portal 2. I haven't even played most of the rest of them *at all*. I played about three hours of Pokemon Soul Silver, and about an hour of Ocarina of Time, but that's been about it. Games are just not as enjoyable anymore I guess?

The moral here is not to make gaming into a chore, play when you feel like, and not when you don't.

Don't make a list, you probably won't stick to it and then you'll end up writing a blog post similar to this one! That being said, I would quite like to complete at least one or two of these before Super Mario 3D Land, and Mario Kart 7 pop through my door in the next few months! Let's go with Soul Silver (since I only have to beat the Elite 4) and Ocarina of Time 3D (because my 3DS is criminally underused. On the not so portable side, I really want to get into Cthulhu Saves the World again, and possibly Disgaea 3. But it's not going to happen.
