My weekly activity started strong. I managed my active calorie ring every single day (time to up my target!), smashing it on the Monday + 32 minutes of 'exercise' & 14 hours standing.

Err, it all went downhill from there... I feel like I should at the very least be completing my Active Calories AND my Stand Goal.

I don't really feel like I achieve the ring goals this week.

Moving on to number 2... Well, I did not complete any workouts. And I feel bad. Hopefully this motivates me more next time! I think I will shorten the workouts to at least get them logged.

\#3... I started using RescueTime in conjuction with [Exist.io](https://exist.io/dashboard/) which is a dashboard of 'everything':... Apple Health, Last.FM, the weather, productive time (more on this shortly), MyFitnessPal, and so many more. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're into stats/data and want to see correlations from your own life.

It seems I am a lazy bum on the weekends, so I think I will go for a walk later....!

Exist.io gets its productivity data from a service called '[RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/)'. This runs on my work computer only and basically tracks if what I am currently doing is productive or distracting. For the first few days, I was obsessing over the reports but now I am happy to just let it run and look every couple of days.

For the first full week, I wanted to hit 4 hours of 'productive' time a day. I logged 25h27m on RescueTime in total this week. 18h14m 'very productive', 2h17m 'productive', with less than 2.5 hours of distracting time. I spent 4 days in the office, so it seemsÂ  I smashed my 4 hour a day a goal! Result!

\#4... I have a draft in Onenote waiting to be finalised! Spoiler, I played iOS games this week! Normal backlog service will resume soonish.

\#5... We went through some more stuff, but it's getting harder now. Sentimental value is kicking in! Perhaps better storage solutions are the key to happiness in this regard.

\#6... See number 4...
